    "In TensorFlow the computation is formally a graph, with nodes representing operations while edges representing tensors (multidimensional data) communicated between operations. According to TensorFlow web site, the flow of tensors through the graph is where TensorFlow gets its name. It is not intended to be only a neural network library but to perform any computation that can be expressed as a graph. TensorFlow automatic differentiation is especially suited for gradient based machine learning algorithms. The library is written in C++ and it has nice Python bindings. Moreover it can run both on CPU and GPU. \n",

For example PyTorch is suitable for reasearch because it is flexible enough to create new models but it is not suitable for production because it does note scale well. Other frameworks such as Caffe and MXNet are scalable but lack flexibility. Tensorflow is both **flexible** and **scalable** and allows users to go easility from research into production."

    "**NOTE:** How to train such a linear model? There is however a simple closed formula to solve a linear regression model, but we will define a loss function and an optimization operation, that will be inserted into the graph (it will be helpful later on when we will see Neural Networks). The loss function defines a method to evaluate model performance. The loss function defines a distance between the predicted values and the target values, and it is used as input to the optimization procedure that finds a set of parameters that minimize the loss function. The most common loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), that finds the squared distance between a set of points and then averages the results over all points. The optimization operation is gradient descent that iteratively updates the weights in a way that decreases loss over time. The update rule is based on the gradient of the loss function. If the loss is a multivariate function of the weights $F(\\hat w)$, then in the neighborhood of some pointÂ $\\hat w_0$, the *steepest* direction of decrease of $F(\\hat w)$Â is obtained by moving fromÂ $\\hat w_0$Â in the direction of the negative gradient of $F$Â at $\\hat w_0$.
