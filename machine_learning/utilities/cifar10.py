#
# Functions for downloading the CIFAR-10 data-set from the internet
# and loading it into memory.
#
# Implemented in Python 3.5
#
# Usage:
# 1) Set the variable data_path with the desired storage path.
# 2) Call maybe_download_and_extract() to download the data-set
#    if it is not already located in the given data_path.
# 3) Call load_class_names() to get an array of the class-names.
# 4) Call load_training_data() and load_test_data() to get
#    the images, class-numbers and one-hot encoded class-labels
#    for the training-set and test-set.
# 5) Use the returned data in your own program.
#
# Format:
# The images for the training- and test-sets are returned as 4-dim numpy
# arrays each with the shape: [image_number, height, width, channel]
# where the individual pixels are floats between 0.0 and 1.0.
